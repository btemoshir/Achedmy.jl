<!-- # Achedmy.jl -- Adaptive CHEmical Dynamics using MemorY -->

<!-- This package implements the **memory corrections** to the mean field dynamics of chemcial reaction networks (CRNs) with discrete number intrinsic noise which are significant in the regime of large flucatiations or small molecules.

The observables like the mean molecular numbers $\mu(t)$ for the entire course of the dynamics and all two-time quantities like the response function $R(t,t')$, correlation function $C(t,t')$ and number-number correlation functions $N(t,t')$ are calculated.

The following approximations to the dynamics are implemented in this package:
1. **gSBR** - generalized self-consistent bubble resummation approximation.
2. **SBR** - self-consistent bubble resummation approximation.
3. **MCA** - mode coupling approximation.
4. **MAK** - mass action kinetics (mean field dynamics without memory corrections).

The CRNs are defined using [`Catalyst.jl`](https://docs.sciml.ai/Catalyst/stable/) and at the backend the package uses [`KB.jl`](https://nonequilibriumdynamics.github.io/KadanoffBaym.jl/stable/) to solve the resulting two time equations using adaptive time steps.

# Achedmy.jl -- Adaptive CHEmical Dynamics using MemorY

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A Julia package implementing **memory-corrected dynamics** for chemical reaction networks (CRNs) with discrete molecular number fluctuations. Achedmy captures the effects of intrinsic noise that become significant in the regime of small molecule numbers or large fluctuations, going beyond standard mean-field approximations.

## Overview

Chemical reaction networks in biological systems often involve small numbers of molecules, leading to significant stochastic fluctuations. Traditional mean-field approaches (Mass Action Kinetics) fail to capture these effects accurately. Achedmy implements a hierarchy of approximations based on **dynamical variational free energy approximation** with **Plefka-type expansion** that systematically incorporates memory corrections to the dynamics.

The CRNs are defined using [`Catalyst.jl`](https://docs.sciml.ai/Catalyst/stable/) and at the backend the package uses [`KB.jl`](https://nonequilibriumdynamics.github.io/KadanoffBaym.jl/stable/) to solve the resulting two time equations using adaptive time steps.

### What Achedmy Computes

- **Mean molecular numbers** $\langle n_i(t) \rangle$ or $\mu_i(t)$ over time
- **Response functions** $R_{ij}(t,t')$ - how perturbations propagate
- **Correlation functions** $C_{ij}(t,t')$ - connected correlations
- **Number-number correlations** $N_{ij}(t,t') = \langle \delta n_i(t) \delta n_j(t') \rangle$
- **Variances and covariances** at equal and unequal times
- **Associated self-energies** $\Sigma_{ij}(t,t')$ encoding memory effects

All quantities are computed with [adaptive two-time solvers](https://nonequilibriumdynamics.github.io/KadanoffBaym.jl/stable/) for efficiency and accuracy. This ensures that the we can simulate multiple orders of magnitude in time scales without excessive computational cost.

## Quick Start

Here's a minimal example computing the dynamics of a gene regulation system:

```julia
using Achedmy
using Catalyst

# Define the reaction network using Catalyst
gene_system = @reaction_network begin
    @species G(t)=0 P(t)=10
    @parameters k_on=0.1 k_off=1.0 k_p=10.0 k_d=1.0
    (k_on, k_off), 0 <--> G
    k_p, G --> G + P
    k_d, P --> 0
end

# Create structure and variables
structure = Achedmy.ReactionStructure(gene_system)
variables = Achedmy.ReactionVariables(structure, "cross")

# Solve dynamics using gSBR approximation
sol = Achedmy.solve_dynamics!(
    structure, 
    variables,
    selfEnergy = "gSBR",
    tmax = 10.0,
    tstart = 0.0,
    atol = 1e-3,
    rtol = 1e-2
)

# Access results
mean_proteins = variables.μ[2, :]  # Mean protein number over time
variance_proteins = diag(variables.N[2, 2, :, :])  # Variance over time
```

---

## Usage Guide

### Step 1: Define Your Reaction Network

Use [`Catalyst.jl`](https://docs.sciml.ai/Catalyst/stable/) to define your CRN:

```julia
using Catalyst

# Example: Enzyme kinetics (Michaelis-Menten)
enzyme_system = @reaction_network begin
    @species S(t)=1.0 E(t)=0.9 C(t)=0.1 X(t)=0.1
    @parameters k_f=1.0 k_b=0.1 k_d=1.0 k_2X=1.0 k_2S=1.0 k_1S=1.0
    (k_f, k_b), S + E <--> C
    k_d, C --> E + X
    k_2X, X --> 0
    (k_2S, k_1S), S <--> 0
end
```

### Step 2: Create Structure and Variables

```julia
using Achedmy

# Create reaction structure (stoichiometry, rates, etc.)
structure = Achedmy.ReactionStructure(enzyme_system)

# Create variables container
# Use "cross" for full cross-correlations, "single" for single-species only
variables = Achedmy.ReactionVariables(structure, "cross")
```

### Step 3: Solve the Dynamics

```julia
sol = Achedmy.solve_dynamics!(
    structure,
    variables,
    selfEnergy = "gSBR",    # Choose: "gSBR", "SBR", "MCA", "MAK"
    tmax = 10.0,            # Final time
    tstart = 0.0,           # Initial time
    atol = 1e-3,            # Absolute tolerance
    rtol = 1e-2             # Relative tolerance
)
```

### Step 4: Extract Results

```julia
# Time grid
time = sol.t

# Mean trajectories for species i
mean_trajectory = variables.μ[i, :]

# Variance for species i at time t
variance_i = diag(variables.N[i, i, :, :])

# Cross-correlation between species i and j at time (t, t')
cross_corr = variables.N[i, j, t_idx, tp_idx]

# Response function R_ij(t, t')
response = variables.R[i, j, t_idx, tp_idx]

# Correlation function C_ij(t, t')
correlation = variables.C[i, j, t_idx, tp_idx]
```

## Approximation Methods

Achedmy implements four approximation schemes of increasing accuracy:

### 1. MAK (Mass Action Kinetics)
- **Description:** Standard mean-field theory, no fluctuations
- **Use case:** Quick baseline comparison
- **Accuracy:** Poor for small copy numbers
- **Cost:** Lowest

### 2. MCA (Mode Coupling Approximation)
- **Description:** Includes correlations via mode coupling
- **Use case:** Intermediate systems
- **Accuracy:** Better than MAK, but limited
- **Cost:** Moderate

### 3. SBR (Self-consistent Bubble Resummation)
- **Description:** Self-consistent treatment of single-species bubbles
- **Use case:** Systems where cross-correlations are weak
- **Accuracy:** Good for weakly coupled species
- **Cost:** Moderate-High

### 4. gSBR (Generalized SBR) ⭐ **Recommended**
- **Description:** Full self-consistent treatment with cross-correlations
- **Use case:** General chemical reaction networks
- **Accuracy:** Best available, validated against master equation
- **Cost:** Highest (but worth it!)

**Rule of thumb:** Always start with gSBR unless computational cost is prohibitive.

## Troubleshooting

### Memory Issues with Large Systems

For systems with many species (>10) or long times:
- Use `"single"` response type instead of `"cross"`
- Increase `atol` and `rtol` tolerances
- Reduce time range or increase `dt_min`

### Numerical Instabilities

If you see negative variances or diverging solutions:
- Decrease tolerances (`atol`, `rtol`)
- Check initial conditions are physical (non-negative)
- Try MAK first and then move to SBR, gSBR with single species response and cross species response in order. 
- In case of instabilities, the cross species response gSBR can be more stable than single species response gSBR or any SBR.
- Decrease `dt_max` to force smaller time steps. 

---

## Performance Tips

1. **Use cross vs. single wisely:** Cross-correlations are $O(N^2)$ in memory
2. **Adjust tolerances:** Looser tolerances = faster, but less accurate
3. **Pre-compile:** First run includes compilation overhead
4. **Parallelize parameter sweeps:** Use `@threads` or `pmap`

```julia
using Base.Threads

@threads for α in alpha_range
    # Run simulation
end
```
